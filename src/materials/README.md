# SICP as Markdown

This is a Markdown version of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman.

It's created by transforming the HTML version from [sarabander/sicp](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp) using `pandoc` plus some manual text munging to make the Markdown as clear and simple as possible.
